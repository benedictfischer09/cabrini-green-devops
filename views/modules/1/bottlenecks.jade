  h2 Bottlenecks
  p When multiple pieces of hardware work together to accomplish a task there will always be one part that is performing at its maximum speed.  Other parts of the system might be able to move faster but they are limited or "bottlenecked" by the slowest part.
  p This idea of bottlenecks is very important in computing. Bottle necks can be studied in hardware or in software.  When multiple programs work together the program that is maxed out is bottlenecking the programs around it. Let's learn more about hardware bottlenecks.

    li If you are trying to download a video and save it and your network can download at 100 MB / s and your hard drive can store data at 500 MB / s which one is creating a bottle neck?
    li If you are running many programs on your CPU and the CPU is showing 100% utilization is it creating a bottleneck for your programs?
    li If you are trying to run many copies of a program on your laptop but you get errors saying that you have run out of memory, what part of your system is your bottleneck?

  h2 Nice Job!
  p You now know how to think about bottlenecks in computing.
