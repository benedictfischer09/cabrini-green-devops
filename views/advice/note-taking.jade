  p Your fork of this repo on Github is a great place for you to store your notes. Spend 15 minutes right now adding terms from the previous lessons to the terms.jade file and defining those terms in a way that makes sense to you.

  p In addition to terms, you are also learning skills (workflows that allow you to perform some action). Add a few skills to the skills.jade page. Example skills might be: how to find a file by its name quickly with your editor or how to create a new branch with git.
